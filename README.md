# !!! Important notes !!!
## Project installation
This project is using GitHub's package system for its dependencies management. Therefore, before adding this project to your IDE you should generate a **GitHub personal access token** and paste it into the `repositories.gradle` file along **with** your **GitHub username**.

I'm not a huge fan of this, but it is way simpler then keeping some jars in the repo.

And for god's sake, don't push your access tokens. GitHub simply won't allow it.
