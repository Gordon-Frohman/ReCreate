## !!!Important note!!!

This project is using GitHub's package system for its dependencies management. Therefore, before adding this project to your IDE you should generate a GitHub personal access token and paste it into the 'repositories.gradle' file along with your GitHub username.

I'm not a huge fan of this, but it is way simpler then keeping some jars in the repo.

And for god's sake, don't push your access tokens. GitHub simply won't allow it.
